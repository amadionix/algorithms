Algorithms &amp; Data Structures in C

Implementations in C of standard algorithms and data sctructures.
The format follows the structure of the course in Algorithms and Data Structures at the University of Milan, taught to bachelor students in Computer Science: in fact it's the solution of (almost) every lab exercise given during the course.

The repository is organized the following way:
every macro-topic (for ex. graphs) has a folder;
inside each of those folders there is a bunch of .pdf files and a src folder;
the .pdf files are explainatory slides from the 2018/2019 edition of the course I mentioned before, along with exercises' texts (those .pdf are mostly in italian);
inside the scr folder are the .c files implementing the solutions to the aforementioned exercises (here I mostly used english for comments and variable names);
