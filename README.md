Algorithms &amp; Data Structures in C

Standard algorithms and data sctructures implemented in C.
The format follows the structure of the course in Algorithms and Data Structures of the University of Milan, taught to bachelor students in Computer Science: in fact it's the solution of (almost) every lab exercise given during the course.

The repository is organized the following way:
every macro-topic (for ex. graphs) has a folder;
inside each of those folders there is a bunch of .pdf files and a src folder;
the .pdf files are explainatory slides from the 2018/2019 edition of the course, along with exercises' texts (those .pdf are mostly in italian);
inside the src folder are the .c files implementing the solutions to the aforementioned exercises (here I mostly used english for comments and variable names);

This repo is  meant as a reference for students of the University of Milan who are preparing for the algo&ds exam, providing them working solutions of the exercises.

Since the algorithms and data structures involved are quite standard, this can also be used as a reference by anybody who is looking for a C implementations of them.

Improvements (cleaner/better implementations) are possible and welcome, just try not to alter the style used (which follows Google C++ Style Guide: https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
